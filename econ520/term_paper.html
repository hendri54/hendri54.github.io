<h1 id="econ520-advancedmacroeconomictheory">Econ520 - Advanced Macroeconomic Theory</h1>

<h2 id="spring2017-prof.lutzhendricks-termpaper">Spring 2017 - Prof. Lutz Hendricks - Term Paper</h2>

<p>The term paper picks a topic, critically reviews the literature, and clearly lays out arguments on both sides of the debate.</p>

<p>The paper is due by the last class meeting.</p>

<p>Before the midterm, each student should submit a 1&#8211;2 page proposal that:</p>

<ul>
<li>states the topic</li>
<li>outlines the main arguments</li>
<li>provides at least 5 relevant references</li>
</ul>

<p>As you write / develop your argument, you should get in touch with me periodically to make sure everything is on track (and to clarify questions).</p>

<p>Please provide all files in <strong>pdf</strong> format (not MS Word). I do not need hardcopies.</p>

<h3 id="expectations">Expectations</h3>

<p>The paper should </p>

<ul>
<li>demonstrate understanding of the literature. Relevant literature might include Fed or IMF publications, the Economist or Wall Street Journal.</li>
<li>lay out arguments on both sides of a debate.</li>
</ul>

<p>I do not expect</p>

<ul>
<li>innovation, modeling, theory, or original data work.</li>
<li>that you read academic journal articles.</li>
<li>that you reach a conclusion. If the experts disagree, I don&#8217;t expect you to figure it out.</li>
</ul>

<p>There is no prescribed length. Obviously, you don&#8217;t want to hand in 2 pages.</p>

<p>Examples of well-written term papers: <a href="term_paper/negative_interest_rates_paper.pdf">Negative interest rates</a>, <a href="term_paper/racial_inequality_paper.pdf">Racial inequality</a>.</p>

<h3 id="notesonwriting">Notes on Writing</h3>

<p><strong>Cite your sources.</strong>
When you make a claim, back it up.</p>

<p><strong>Nice words come last.</strong>
First decide what you want to write. Outline that. When you are happy with the substance, fill in the words.</p>

<p><strong>Visual structure.</strong>
There should be (sub-)headings that let the reader see at a glance how the document is structured.</p>

<h3 id="possibletopicsbutyoumaychooseyourown">Possible Topics (but You May Choose Your Own)</h3>

<p>The topic needs to be fairly narrow. Examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>You could study the importance of international trade for rising income inequality. Studying all possible causes of rising income inequality would be too broad.</li>
<li>You could study the pros and cons of a particular tax proposal (e.g., the flat tax).</li>
</ul>

<p>Below I list potential topics. They are generally phrased more broadly than what you would choose for a term paper.</p>

<p>Growth:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do we need patent protection for innovation to occur?</li>
<li>Why has manufacturing declined in the U.S. (international trade, technical change, &#8230;)?</li>
</ul>

<p>Business cycles:</p>

<ul>
<li>Why was wage growth so slow during the recovery after the Great Recession?</li>
</ul>

<p>Fiscal policy:</p>

<ul>
<li>Effects of austerity policies in Greece or other European countries.</li>
</ul>

<p>Monetary policy:</p>

<ul>
<li>Should the Fed target asset prices?</li>
</ul>

<p>Inequality:</p>

<ul>
<li>Effects of taxing the rich.</li>
<li>Causes of rising income inequality. Potential policy responses.</li>
<li>Labor market polarization: what will happen when more and more jobs get mechanized?</li>
</ul>

<p>Open economy:</p>

<ul>
<li>Are exchange rate devaluations expansionary?</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="findingsourcematerial">Finding source material</h1>

<p>Academic journal articles are generally hard to read. Feel free to look, though, and you will get an idea what professional economists actually do.</p>

<p>Sources with overview articles:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Journal of Economic Perspectives</li>
<li>Brookings Institution</li>
<li>Federal Reserve Banks publish articles aimed at explaining research to the general public. Examples are the Economic Letters of the San Francisco Fed.</li>
</ul>

<p>I would generally avoid political sources (Heritage Foundation; Congress; Cato Institute).</p>
