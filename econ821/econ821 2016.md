# Econ821: "Monetary Economics"

### [%ClassTerm]. Prof. Lutz Hendricks. UNC

-----------------

Outline: 

# Announcements #



# Organization

### Objectives
1. Learn about state of the art research in selected areas of macro.
2. Learn how to compute models and take them to the data.
3. Identify potential topics for dissertation research. [See my notes on finding research topics.](../Research/DissertationTips.htm)


### We cover the following broad topics:
1. Economic growth
2. Cross-country income gaps
3. Within country income / wealth inequality. 


### Class structure

A mixture of lectures, [student presentations][studPresent], and hands-on programming.

The lectures present key papers in each topic.

We will then replicate the results of select papers using **Matlab**.

This class is somewhat experimental. We will have to figure out how to efficiently do programming in class as we go along. Suggestions are welcome.


### Grading

The class is graded based on participation in class.

Students are expected to present and discuss state-of-the art papers on the topics we will cover.
