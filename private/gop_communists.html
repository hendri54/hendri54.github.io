<h1 id="thegopsresemblancetothecommunistparty">The GOP&#8217;s Resemblance to the Communist Party</h1>

<p>May&#8211;10, 2020</p>

<p>The Republican Party bears a remarkable resemblance to the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
Ideologically, the two parties advocate very different goals. But in terms of organization and function, they are really quite similar. That is to say: the GOP isn&#8217;t a real political party. It is more like an organized criminal enterprise.</p>

<p>The leadership of the GOP has extraordinary power. Mitch McConnell pretty much single-handedly decides what the Senate gets to discuss or vote on. Members of Congress almost never vote against proposals that the leadership wants to push through. If they do, the punishment is immediate. Recall the fates of the unfortunate <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/03/us/politics/2-republican-senators-revoke-support-for-garland-hearings.html">Senator Moran</a> who dared to consider granting a hearing for Judge Garland? Or Jeff Flake of Arizona? Over time, members of Congress have been selected through primaries, which are cheap to buy, to be compliant. No matter how outrageous or idiotic a Trump statement is, the GOP keeps quiet.</p>

<p>If it is useful, Republicans routinely deny facts. Global warming is a hoax or disputed or not a big deal. Covid 19 is under control. Tax cuts create budget surpluses. Hardly any GOP representative dares to say the emperor wears no clothes.</p>

<p>How did we get here?</p>

<p>There is no hidden bad guy who runs the GOP. There is no grand conspiracy. Instead, I think we got there step by little step, over a very long period of time. </p>

<p>It all started in the 1970s when a GOP strategist thought of a way of winning over evangelicals, who were not GOP affiliated back then. The idea was to make abortion, which was not particularly controversial back then, a hot button issue and to convince evangelicals that the right to life was an issue that should decide, by itself, who they voted for. To implement this, the GOP teamed up with a later famous pastor. Together they started to push abortion as an issue that could divide liberals from conservatives. Over time, this idea was expanded. By now, the GOP promises evangelicals to make the U.S. a christian state.</p>

<p>Over time, the GOP has accumulated or created more and more items that generate single issue voters. Guns. Immigration. Taxes. Health care. Climate change and environment.</p>

<p>Some of these items are just fear mongering. There does not seem to be well paying interest group behind xenophobia. It is just useful to generate single issue voters. </p>

<p>Other items are pretty much direct handouts to paying customers. The energy industry gets deregulation and subsidies. The health care industry gets a mess of private providers and health insurance. The gun industry gets the second amendment. The rich get tax cuts. Then there are the more targeted handouts. The banking industry gets deregulation after the Great Recession. The oil industry can release methane gas. Each of these items is backed by organizations that directly pay the GOP.</p>

<p>By now, the GOP has put itself into a box. Extremist (or crazy) propaganda organizations have sprung up around the single voter issues that the GOP has been peddling. Think Breitbart, Infowars, or Rush Limbaugh. Or, less on the crazy side, and more on the &#8220;monetize the radicalized GOP supporter&#8221; side is Fox &#8220;News.&#8221; Each of these organizations pushes an extreme position on one or more of the GOP selling points. This constantly pushes the GOP towards the extremes. </p>

<p>The GOP created single issue voters, but it does not control the organizations that form their views, nor does it control the organizations that pay for GOP elections. Any time the GOP wants to take a moderate position, it now faces pushback from the organizations that it depends on (and vice versa). </p>

<p>Finally, Trump came along, taking advantage of the more extreme views in the GOP and pushing them even further out into the fringes of lunacy. The leadership, of course, despises Trump. But they are powerless against the torrent of support that Trump receives from the lunacy fringe on social media and talk radio. This is the irony of the arrangement. The GOP leadership took away all the power from its members, and then lost it all to the demagogues. </p>

<p>The result is that, long term, the GOP is doomed. 90% of young people hate its guts and will never vote GOP in their lives. Basically, the GOP is now trying to hold on to power by any means possible, trying to postpone the inevitable. My prediction is that the GOP will take more and more extreme measures to rig elections so they can win with an ever shrinking minority of votes. At some point, perhaps when the GOP&#8217;s vote share drops to 30%, even the most extreme voter suppression, gerrymandering, voter fraud and (I&#8217;m afraid) prosecution of opposition politicians will no longer be enough to win. At this point, the GOP will collapse. Once the GOP loses the majority in a state, it loses the ability to rig elections and therefore the ability to win. The moneyed supporters will then withdraw their payments and the state will be left with a form of one party Democrat rule. </p>

<p>In the meantime, political institutions in the U.S. will be destroyed. We are now seeing the justice department being turned into the legal branch of the GOP. Trump supporters are now longer subject to the law. I expect that the justice department will initiate some form of investigation or even indictment against Hunter Biden before the election. This will be the first time in U.S. history (as far as I know) that the federal government uses its judicial powers to throw a major election. Vladimir Putin sends his regards.</p>
