# Polarization #

Why do electorates in so many Western democracies become more and more polarized?

Some argue that it has to do with the stagnation of real incomes. I don't think this is the main reason.

My hypothesis is that **polarization is a consequence of the end of the Cold War**.

Humans have evolved to live in clans. We think that our group is the best, be it based on village, nationality, religion, or soccer team. Our gut instincts tells us distrust the others. 

Successful politicians exploit this group instinct to rally their supporters against (typically made up) enemies. The obvious choices for such enemies are racial minorities (no longer politically acceptable, unless dressed up nicely), gays, immigrants, foreign countries (international trade), big corporations, and the rich.

People have trouble rallying behind someone who just proposes sensible policies that are *for* something, like Barack Obama. But they can rally behind leaders who are against a threat. This is why Bernie Sanders is so popular. He runs against greed, big corporations, and the rich. To his credit, he believes all this.

The successful recipe of Donald Trump consisted of collecting all of the fears people feel into a platform. People fear for their jobs; Trump blames immigrants, trade, and environmental regulation. People fear for their safety; Trump blames immigrants and Muslims. Ironically, Trump also blamed big banks and Wall Street and, of course, the Washington swamp.

How does the Cold War fit in? For a long time, we had a shared enemy that we could rally against: Communism and the Soviet Union. This allowed us to come together as one group and agree on centrist domestic policies. We did not need to divide the country into factions. The enemy was right there, outside of the country. 

As a result, we could agree to be *for* policies, such as space exploration, science, and free markets. These could be presented as part of the competition against Communism. Then the Cold War ended and the obvious enemy disappeared. Naturally, politicians are now stepping in to create new enemies that we can unite against.
