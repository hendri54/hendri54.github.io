<h1 id="presidentialdictatorship">Presidential Dictatorship</h1>

<p>The U.S. is turning into a presidential dictatorship.</p>

<p>The president controls</p>

<ul>
<li>law enforcement (the justice department, courtesy of lapdog attorney general Bill Barr)</li>
<li>the federal courts</li>
<li>the U.S. supreme court</li>
<li>the Federal Election commission (which has just been disabled)</li>
</ul>

<p>This effectively ends congressional oversight. The ruling party can simply refuse to provide information to Congress, even if this is clearly mandated by law. The current example is the Ukraine whistleblower complaint.</p>

<p>Even if the opposition were to win a surpreme court ruling (highly unlikely, given that the supreme court has been hand-picked to maximize [Republican?] presidential power), it really does not matter any more. Court rulings have no teeth unless they are enforced by the justice department.</p>

<p>This is a surprisingly obvious flaw in the U.S. constitution: the justice department is supposed to enforce the law against the administration which also controls it. How was that supposed to work?</p>

<p>The Congress has thereby also lost a good chunk of its budgetary authority. Claiming emergencies, the president can now move funds around pretty much any way he pleases. </p>

<p>The consequences of this situation will become increasingly stark as the next election approaches. This election will be tight. If the polls don&#8217;t look good for Trump, I expect the administration to pull out all the stops to manipulate its outcomes. </p>

<ul>
<li>I expect the justice department to investigate the leading Democrat presidential candidate for some imagined wrongdoing. Naturally, the details of this investigation will be leaked to the media.</li>
<li>Perhaps the IRS will be used for similar purposes.</li>
<li>There will be voter suppression. Polling stations will be closed in locations with high Democrat turnout. Voter rolls will be purged. Votes will be discarded based on technicalities. Perhaps law enforcement will be positioned at polling stations where Democrats turn out (this has happened in the past and the consent agreement barring this behavior recently expired).</li>
<li>Interference in the election by foreign and domestic agents will be tolerated (as long as this favors Republicans, of course). This is arguably why Republicans refuse to debate bills that strenghten election security.</li>
<li>The Fed will be pressured, perhaps by replacing J Powell, to give the economy a boost.</li>
</ul>

<p>If this is not enough, I expect that the U.S. will go to war against Iran. This scenario is already being prepared (rhetorically). A made-for-TV war, covered live by sympathetic journalists (others won&#8217;t have access) would surely boost Trump&#8217;s poll numbers.</p>
