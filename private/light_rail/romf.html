<h1 id="romflocationopposition">ROMF Location Opposition</h1>

<h2 id="emailsentbyhendricksfamilytodurhamcitycouncil">Email sent by Hendricks family to Durham city council</h2>

<p>Dear X:</p>

<p>With this letter, we bring to your attention our objections against the proposed light rail maintenance facility (ROMF) to be located along Farrington Road in Durham.</p>

<p>Our primary concern is noise. The Farrington site is directly adjacent to several residential communities. It is also very close to Creekside Elementary School (less than 1/4 mile away). It is highly unusual to locate an industrial facility in such a location. </p>

<p>The ROMF will be operated around the clock. Trains will start to leave the facility at 5am and return around midnight. Before departing, trains will test their bells or horns. This process will start at 5am and last for about one hour at a noise level of around 100 dBA. In addition, due to the shape of the site, trains need to navigate narrow turns when entering the ROMF which creates grinding noises of around 136 dBA, comparable to a jet airplane engine. This noise will occur throughout the day and night as trains are moved for maintenance. Even while the site is &#8220;at rest&#8221;, it is expected to generate 99 dBA of noise due to generators etc.</p>

<p>For any other source of noise, this would be entirely outside of the limits permitted by the City of Durham Code of Ordinances (Sec. 26&#8211;4 to 26&#8211;22). These prohibit sound levels exceeding 50 dBA outside the hours of 11pm to 8am. They also specifically prohibit the sounding of any horns, except in emergencies. DOE workplace regulations limit workers to no more than 15 minutes of 100 dBA noise exposure per day. The ROMF will generate this level of noise at 50 feet of distance around the clock.</p>

<p>There are several additional concerns with the Farrington location.</p>

<ol>
<li>The ROMF stores large quantities of controlled substances. This includes 1,000 gallons of used oil (after residents were promised that no oil changes would take place on site). Some of these substances are explosive. Others are toxic. This is supposed to happen within 1/4 mile of Creekside Elementary School.</li>
<li>The Farrington site contains wetlands which would be entirely destroyed. These wetlands help to control flooding of I&#8211;40 and surrounding areas.</li>
<li>The site prevents the future widening of Farrington road, which is one of only two significant roads that connect US15/501 with NC54. The other road is Garrett which is already crowded.</li>
</ol>

<p>Moving the ROMF to the Leigh Village area adjacent to NC54 would sidestep these concerns. The area is adjacent to the planned light rail track and currently undeveloped. It would offer easy vehicle access via NC54 and I&#8211;40. </p>

<p>If the Farrington site is built against the objections of neighboring residents, these residents will need to be compensated for their loss of home values. We would expect that these claims will result in lawsuits against the city.</p>

<p>We therefore urge you to vote against rezoning the Farrington site for industrial use.</p>

Margarita and Lutz Hendricks

<h2 id="commentssentbyhendricksfamily">Comments sent by Hendricks family</h2>

<p>This comment relates to the Durham/Orange County (NC) Light Rail project.
I object to the planned Farrington Road ROMF facility on the grounds of noise.
The plans submitted by GoTriangle indicate persistent, round-the-clock noise of 99dBA and peak noise of around 136dBA, even at night.
This is not acceptable for a facility that is located right next to an elementary school (0.25 miles away) and adjacent to residential neighborhoods.</p>

<p>I object to the planned Farrington Road ROMF facility because it will impede traffic flowing between US15/501 and NC54.
Farrington Road is one of only two significant roads that connect the two main thoroughfares in Durham: US15/501 and NC54. The other (Garrett Road) is already overcrowded with traffic. The planned ROMF would permanently prevent Farrington Road from being widened to 4 lanes. This would happen at the same time as hundreds of additional homes are built in the vicinity with thousands more to come in the future. Moreover, crossing trains would close Farrington Road every 10 minutes.</p>

<p>I object to the planned Farrington Road ROMF facility because it poses safety hazards for the surrounding neighborhoods and for the elementary school located right next to it (within 0.25 miles).
The ROMF site is planned to hold large quantities of controlled fluids, including 1,000 gallons of used oil. Some of these fluids pose fire or explosion risks. The fluids would have to be hauled to and from the site by truck, posing further safety concerns. All of this is supposed to happen in the middle of a residential area.</p>

<p>I object to the planned Farrington Road ROMF facility because potentially dangerous chemicals will be stored on the property. Those chemicals are not listed in specificity in the critical environmental documents. The public has had no opportunity to be intelligently informed or to comment based on that information. That is a violation of NEPA requirements.</p>

<p>I object to the planned Farrington Road ROMF facility which would destroy all of the existing wetlands currently on the site. These wetlands protect the surrounding areas, including I&#8211;40 from flooding. They would be replaced with impervious surfaces.</p>

<p>I object to the planned Farrington Road ROMF facility because the existing noise impact studies are insufficient.
As the project progressed, GoTriangle gradually and reluctantly disclosed more and more noise that will emanate from the facility. Only recently have residents learned that trains will generate 136dBA of track squeal each time they make the tight turns when they enter the facility or the maintenance building. Also only recently disclosed was ongoing noise of 99dBA apparently due to electric generators.</p>

<p>I object to the planned Farrington Road ROMF facility on the grounds that GoTriangle withheld or obscured information during the public comment period for the project.
Go Triangle’s website was riddled with broken links for several weeks while a new website was being developed right in the middle of the notice and comment period.
The maps provided during the notice and comment period excluded homes in the adjacent Culp Arbor subdivision that are located within 200 feet of the site. The study is therefore invalid.</p>

<p>I object to the planned Farrington Road ROMF facility because the existing noise and vibration study was incomplete. Even its October 2018 update does not include homes in the adjacent Cupl Arbor subdivision that are located within 200 feet of the site. It also fails to account for spikes in noise which will occur in the middle of the night as trains are moved around for maintenance.</p>

<p>I object to the planned Farrington Road ROMF facility because it is too small and poorly shaped for the purpose.
The site&#8217;s awkward shape forces trains to execute 90 degree turns as they are moved around the the site, causing extremely loud track squeal noise at all times of day and night.
Moreover, the site lacks room for expansion. The light rail can only make sense as part of a denser rail network. Yet the proposed site will be at capacity even as it handles the rolling stock of a single 17 mile track.</p>

<p>I object to the planned Farrington Road ROMF facility because it will reduce home values in surrounding neighborhoods.
The proposed site is located in a residential area. There are no commercial or industrial properties anywhere nearby. There will be insufficient transitional protections between the propsoed industrial site and the surrounding homes. Some houses will be less than 200 feet from the site. Their property values will diminish massively.
GoTriangle has not carried out a devaluation study.</p>
