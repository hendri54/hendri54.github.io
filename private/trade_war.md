# Why Trump is starting a trade war #

Posted 2018-Mar-3.

Many observers still try to understand the motivation behind Trump's policy actions. They generally try to understand which policy goals are served. This is a fundamental misunderstanding. Trump does not have **policy** goals -- he has **political** goals.

In this light, how is a trade war beneficial for Trump?

The big picture is Trump needs to manufacture enemies that he can rally voters against. Immigrants make great enemies, but they don't fight back. So how to get an enemy that fights back? Answer: start a trade war.

In a little while, we will see that Trump claims that China started the trade war. He will rail against unfair practices and complain that Democrats don't do anything to defend the U.S. against this threat. Hence, he will say: vote for me and I will deal with those Chinese crooks.
