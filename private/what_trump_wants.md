# Interpreting Trump #

Many observers ask: 

> What are Trump's policy plans? What does he want to achieve?

I think these questions fail to understand Trump.

I view all of Trump's actions as part of his re-election campaign. He will do whatever makes him popular. 

### Examples ###

1. The executive order on Obamacare, signed on his first day in office.
	The executive order is so vague, it's essentially a statement of broad intent. What then is the point? Trump sets himself up to say: "I kept my promise and repealed Obamacare on my first day in office."
	
	In reality, I expect that the repeal of Obamacare will be mainly cosmetic ("repeal and rename"). Actually changing Obamacare substantively would be highly unpopular. There is, of course, no plan to cover more people at lower cost. If there were, we would have probably seen some form of public discussion / bragging about it. So the optimal action is to do just enough so Trump can claim that Obamacare has been repealed and is now so much better.

2. The inauguration speech

	Why this description of America in the dumpster? Quite a bit of it is hard to support with facts. Notably, the economy is doing rather well, except that inequality is extremely high.

	The answer is obvious once one views this as a campaign speech. Trump is setting himself up to be able to say: "Look how awful everything was when I took over. Now it is so much better."

## Update 2017-March ##

A pattern is becoming clearer. Here is the Trumpian recipe for policy:

1. Identify a problem. Something that a group of voters views as a major threat. Examples: loss of manufacturing jobs in the Rust Belt; rising health care costs.
2. Invent an enemy who supposedly caused the problem.
	3. For job losses: international trade (prefably with a specific country: China).
	4. For rising health care costs: Obamacare.

	The key is: it must be possible to take specific, strong actions against the enemy. So it will not do to blame technology for job losses.
3. Come up with a policy against the enemy (tariffs, immigration restrictions, repeal Obamacare).
4. Claim that the problem has been solved.

In the process, Republicans perform 180 degree reversals of previously held policies (free trade, skilled immigration). Of course, it is somewhat hard to believe that Republicans have collectively changed their minds about many issues since Trump was made the presidential candidate. This is pure cynicism.

## Update 2017-August ##

What looks like madness may actually be a perfectly sensible strategy.

Trump seems to constantly undermine any chances at reelection. Recently, he seems to have said: forget the political implications; I'll just say what I want. (E.g., Charlotteville, threatening government shutdown if the border wall is not funded).

Everything he does is aimed at his core supporters. Trump does not care whether his actions alienate the majority of voters. This seems irrational as a reelection campaign. Especially for a president who has been campaigning essentially since the day he got into office.

The key to understanding all of this is: **Trump has no intention of running in 2020**. Two reasons for this:

1. He does not want to be President. When he ran for election, he just wanted the win and enjoy the status that came with it. Being President is something Trump actually hates.
2. He cannot risk losing. This would undermine his legacy.

Trump is campaigning and "governing" for legacy, not for reelection. The plan is to step aside in 2019 with a hand picked successor in place. Trump will claim that he did everything he promised. Now his successor can take over and do the easy stuff (just keep the ship on course).

This narrative is, of course, sufficiently absurd that only his core supporters will buy it. What Trump aims for is to maintain a sufficiently large mass of fervent supporters who buy into this story, so that the myth of the Trump success can be perpetuated. So it is key that the core supporters stay with Trump 100%. Hence the campaign rallies that are tailored to his core supporters.

When Trump's successor inevitably loses the election, he will get the Schwarzenegger treatment.
