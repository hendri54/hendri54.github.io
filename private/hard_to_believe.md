# Hard to Believe but True #

This page collects facts that would have been hard to credit just a few years ago.

### The 2016 election

1. The Trump campaign was in contact with Russia during the election. While Russia manipulated election outcomes. Many Republicans do not want to investigate.
2. Trump claims he has a "secret plan" to defeat ISIS. After coming to office, he asks the military to develop such a plan. Looks like a lie to me.

### The Trump Administration ###

1. An alt-right strategist in the White House.
5. A Representative trades health care shares while chairing a committee the passes laws affecting exactly those companies. He receives favorable share prices, followed by legislation that favors the very company that gave him the deal. Then the Representative becomes Health Secretary.
6. Trump runs on cleaning up Wall Street. Then he hires lots of Wall Street bankers for his administration.
7. Members of the Trump administration walk back Trump tweets, especially on NATO.
8. The president calls the press [enemy of the people](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/26/world/europe/trump-enemy-of-the-people-stalin.html?_r=0) (a term coined by Stalin).
9. The president accuses President Obama of [wiretapping Trump tower](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/04/us/politics/trump-obama-tap-phones.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=first-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news&_r=0) (no evidence is provided). It is becoming more and more inevitable to conclude that Trump is mentally ill.


### 180 degree policy reversals

2. A large majority of voters favor major features of Obamacare; after voting to repeal the law in 2016.
3. Republicans want to close off borders to international trade.
4. Republicans block Obama's proposals to invest in infrastructure. But they go along with Trump's (without knowing how this will be paid for).
5. Global warming is a "Chinese hoax." Then it is real, but probably not related to human activity. Then it is a conspiracy of climate scientists. 
9. [37% of republicans view Putin favorably](https://d25d2506sfb94s.cloudfront.net/cumulus_uploads/document/ro9rimrce9/econTabReport.pdf).
