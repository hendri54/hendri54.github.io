# Time For a Break-Up

The non-response of the federal government to the COVID-19 pandemic is one more piece of evidence that the United States is no longer sustainable as a country. We no longer have a federal government. The states are now left to their own devices, with occasional interference by a federal government that either obeys the whims of an unhinged president or tries to protect the interest groups that support the ruling party (fossil fuels, pharma, guns, evangelicals, ...).

This arrangement leaves the states without a good source of independent tax revenues and with limited powers to arrange their affairs.

The country is also firmly divided into red and blue states. Those groups diverge more and more in terms of social arrangements and values. The population of red states lives in a made-up reality created by the GOP's propaganda apparatus. These states are lost. They are now unreachable by reason and reality.

There are two paths forward. The first keeps the United States united. It implies that the gradual decline towards full blown banana republic status will continue. The alternative is to split the country into several smaller ones. California as a country would likely do just fine. California as part of the United States is doomed.

Breaking up is, of course, not realistic, at least until the GOP self destroys (which it will likely do, thanks to demographic forces and to the fact that the young overwhelmingly despise the GOP). It is therefore time to leave the sinking ship. Those who have the opportunity to move to a country that still functions would be well advised to do so.
