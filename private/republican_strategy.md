# Understanding Republican Policies #

Here is a puzzle: 

> Why do Republicans nowadays advocate policies that are opposed by most experts?

Examples:

1. Climate change: The vast majority of climate scientists agrees that global warming is a major threat that requires immediate, drastic action. Republicans call it a hoax (something no intelligent person actually believes).
2. Trade policy: The vast majority of economists opposes broad based trade restrictions and the repeal of Nafta.
3. Immigration restrictions: Security experts generally argue that refugees are vetted sufficiently well not to pose a significant security threat. Republicans advocate keeping all refugees out.
4. LGBT rights: How about NC's house bill 2?

Assuming that Republicans do not hold the view that they understand each subject matter better than the experts in the field, I must conclude that Republicans advocate policies that they know to be harmful.

Why?

I think the answer is that each policy area is chosen to energize a set of voters. The **fundamental insight** is:

> Voter turnout decides elections. If you want high turnout, find something that voters fear.

Now let's revisit the policy areas mentioned above:

1. Climate change: 
	2. The narrative is: "Environmentalists damage our economy and cost jobs. Vote for us. We will protect your jobs by opposing environmental regulations and renewable energy."
	3. The target audience: workers in the rust belt (coal mining); also workers in sectors that benefit from cheap energy (autos).
4. Trade policy: the narrative and target audiences are obvious.
5. Immigration restrictions:
	6. The narrative is: "Immigrants take away your jobs." Since it is not yet politically acceptable to be openly xenophobic, the argument can be dressed up in national security terms.
	7. The target audience: workers in declining areas with high unemployment or lack of well paying jobs.
8. LGBT rights:
	9. The narrative: "LGBT people threaten the family."
	10. The target audience: social conservatives.
	
Viewed this way, one begins to understand why Republicans go against the experts all the time. There aren't enough real enemies to generate high voter turnout. The Republican response has been to invent ficticious enemies. Of course, the experts point out that these enemies are not real. But then, who believes expert opinions any more?

This theory also explains the extreme opposition to the Obama administration. It is unprecendented for an opposition leader to say openly that the Republicans' number one goal is to ensure the failure of the current administration. I suggest that the objective was to tie the Obama administration to the ficticious enemies and thereby to make Obama himself into a public enemy.

These tactics are, of course, far from new. Julius Caesar used similar methods to make himself Rome's dictator.

The fundemental problem with the Republican strategy is: it destroys democracy. Democracy can only function if lawmakers are not purely selfish. There needs to be a willingness to compromise and to pass laws that are generally viewed as good for the country. Instead, Republicans have taken the view that their job is to oppose everything the opposition proposes (recall McConell's famous pronouncement that the main goal is to ensure that Obama fails).

In the past, elections ensured that purely selfish candidates did not get elected in large numbers. Now that "Fakebook" and Twitter have replaced journalism, this no longer works.
