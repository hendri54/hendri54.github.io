# A List of Appalling Trump Policies #

The following is a list of Trump policies / proposals / statements that I find appalling. 

Based on this list, I have to ask:

* Have we really become that selfish? Where is the compassion for anyone who happens not to be American?
* Are the voters really that dumb?
* Is it time to emigrate to a more civilized country?

2017:

* Jan-28: Syrian refugees are no longer allowed to enter the U.S. (a violation of international law).
* Jan-27: 
	* A proposed 20% tax on Mexican imports.
	* A potential tax on imports by companies who produce abroad (illegal).
* Jan-20:
	* "Only America First"
