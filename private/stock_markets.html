<h1 id="stockmarketinsanity.">Stock market insanity.</h1>

<p>4/20/2020</p>

<p>The stock market today is at the same level as at the end of May of 2019 (S&amp;P at 2800). Stocks just rallied more than 20% as a series of bad economic news arrived, including 10 million new unemployment claims.</p>

<p>This fits a pattern: the stock market nowadays only responds to short term payoffs, preferably from the federal government. We had many episodes in recent years where stocks rallied on bad economic news, the explanation being that the Fed would lower interest rates. </p>

<p>Now we are at the start of the deepest recession since at least the Great Depression and stocks rally because the government hands out cash. I now view stocks as pure bubbles. This renders the usual justification for spending lots of resources on well functioning financial markets moot. It is time to tax the entire finance industry and stop devoting a large share of GDP to an activity that just adds volatility to the economy.</p>
