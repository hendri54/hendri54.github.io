<h1 id="thoughtsonthe2016presidentialelection">Thoughts on the 2016 Presidential Election</h1>

<p>The question: How could Donald Trump win the election?</p>

<p>I propose the following answer: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Republican party has specialized in voters who form policy related beliefs not based on evidence but based on prejudice. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Donald Trump took this specialization to the logical conclusion. His victory indicates that about half of the American electorate form beliefs in complete disregard of facts or evidence.</p>

<p>The argument: </p>

<p>Consider <strong>climate change</strong>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/many-more-republicans-now-believe-in-climate-change/">A large fraction of Republicans / conservatives believe that man-made climate change is not real</a>. The fraction among Democrats / liberals is much smaller.</p>

<p>How is that possible? I can see three logical explanations</p>

<ol>
<li>After careful reading of the evidence, conservatives come to a different conclusion that liberals.
That seems hard to believe. Why would a person&#8217;s view on social issues change one&#8217;s reading of climate science evidence?</li>
<li>There is a grand conspiracy. A large majority of climate scientists have come together to falsify the evidence.
This view strikes me as ludicrous. Science does not work this way. Industry money is on the other side of the argument. Grand conspiracies are always imaginary.</li>
<li>Conservatives or liberals (or both) form their beliefs without considering the evidence. They want to believe one side of the argument. So they distort the evidence until it fits that view.</li>
</ol>

<p>The last option seems the only logical one.</p>

<p>Which side is then guilty of disregarding evidence? Presumably the one that goes against the expert consensus.</p>

<p>The bigger picture: Republicans have for some time specialized in voters who form beliefs to suit their prejudices. </p>

<p>One example: <strong>Creationism</strong>. </p>

<p>Evidently, <a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/145286/four-americans-believe-strict-creationism.aspx">52% of Republicans</a> believe that God created the world as an elaborate hoax. A giant movie set with fake fossils and mountain ranges that look like they were formed by tectonic movements.</p>

<p>Donald Trump has taken this specialization to the logical conclusion. He formed a coalition of one-issue voters (abortion, climate change, international trade, immigration, taxes). He then told each group of voters what they wanted to hear. This worked because he appealed to voters who disregarded evidence. To these voters, it did not matter that Trump contradicted himself from one speech to the next.</p>

<p>If one can win an election based on a coalition of easily manipulated voters, what does this imply for Democracy?</p>
