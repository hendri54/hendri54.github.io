# The Need for Constitutional Reform #

America elected Trump.

Congress goes along with all manner of [appalling policy proposals](trump_policies.html) made by Trump.

That means the constitution needs to be changed.

The U.S. constitution is 200 years old. It has remained essentially unchanged over the entire period. It does not work any more.

I suspect that the **invention of TV** has made the constitution obsolete. Before TV, news and entertainment were separate. News simply was not entertaining. Demand for information sustained an industry of news organizations that actually produced news. 

The arrival of TV made it possible to blend news and entertainment. It forced traditional news outlets to become more entertaining in order to remain competitive. The news became less relevant (as in: "what did the first lady wear in Riadh?"), more  biased, and more sensational. In Germany, it is said of the "newspaper" `Das Bild`: don't tilt it, or the blood will drip out of it. 

Eventually, someone figured out how to blend news, entertainment, and propaganda. Fox was born. Fox recognizes that people want "news" stories that confirm the views they already hold. Conspiracies are popular. Once viewers see only one side of the story, the facts become less relevant. Combine this with propaganda against traditional news outlets and you have vehicle for viewer manipulation that actually makes money. 

Hint to Democrats: you need your own version of Fox.

I am not a constitutional scholar, but here is one **proposal**:

> The president should not be elected directly by the people.

In many countries, voters elect a party. The majority party then chooses a president (or chancellor). This approach prevents a demagogue from coming to power.

Our constitution is not designed to handle a situation where the majority of voters fail to understand basic facts. Now that many voters get their "news" from places like Facebook (perhaps it should be called **Fakebook** instead), an additional layer needs to be placed between the choices of the people and the policies that get implemented.

The U.S. is the only country where a major political party has drifted far into the radical fringes. I suspect this happened here because our constitution essentially guarantees that only two parties are viable. In other countries, right wing radicals have formed fringe parties (the German ADF, the French National Front). The U.S. constitution made this approach hopeless. Therefore, the radicals have taken over the Republican party instead. Now would be a good time for moderate Republicans to split off, but that is also hopeless. We need a multi-party system.

Other items that seem questionable to me:

1. The president selects the Attorney General, who is then supposed to ensure that the administration follows the law. 
2. Local AG's are elected. This creates obvious conflicts of interest.
3. Judges are elected by voters who don't know anything about them.
4. The president (or governor) can be of a party that holds a minority in both houses of Congress. The obvious result: governance by executive order and gridlock. When this happens, no government appointments can proceed, including Supreme Court justices.
