<h1 id="predictionsforthetrumppresidency">Predictions for the Trump Presidency</h1>

<p>November 8, 2016 was a very bad day for the Republican Party. It likely ended the political careers of all current major Republican players (Ryan, McConnell, &#8230;).</p>

<p>Here are my predictions for the Trump Presidency (as of Nov&#8211;12, 2016):</p>

<ol>
<li>It will be <strong>short</strong>.
I expect Republicans to lose the Senate in 2018 and I expect them to lose big time in 2020.
The reason is that the current Trump coalition cannot be repeated. The coalition consists of angry voters who <a href="trump_voters.html">form their beliefs based on prejudice</a>, disregarding the evidence. In 2020, these people will still be angry, but then Trump will have been in power for four years.
The risk is that these voters have essentially fixed beliefs. Even if Trump turns out to be the worse president in history, it may not affect their views at all.</li>
<li>There will be a trickle of embarrassments and <strong>scandals</strong>.
I expect revelations of Trump&#8217;s past to keep coming in. There could be lawsuits. There will of course be major policy mistakes. There will be cover-ups. There may even be politically motivated investigations of opposition figures (Guiliani for Attorney General?).</li>
<li>Trump will attempt to massively extend the reach of the executive branch.</li>
<li>There will be political <strong>pressure on the justice department</strong> and Federal law enforcement agencies. Scandals need to be suppressed. Opposition investigations will be created. FBI director Comy decided the 2016 election. This will be attempted again.</li>
<li>There will be constant criticism by experts and the press.
Uniquely, pretty much all of Trump&#8217;s major positions are pretty much unamimously opposed by experts and the press.</li>
<li>There will be big <strong>fiscal deficits</strong>.
Trump wants to be popular, so he will hand out goodies to voters. He also likes tax cuts. Trump will engineer an economic expansion near the 2020 election to boost his reelection chances.</li>
<li>Trump will fulfill all of his major <strong>campaign promises</strong>, but only cosmetically.

<ol>
<li>Obamacare will be repealed and replaced with a &#8220;new&#8221; program that keeps Obamacare&#8217;s key features (universal coverage independent of employment, coverage of pre-existing conditions). One might call this &#8220;repeal and rename.&#8221;</li>
<li>The wall on the Mexican border will not be built. But there will be a few sections, so Trump can claim he kept his promise.</li>
<li>Nafta will be cosmetically renegotiated. Of course, it no longer make sense to reverse its key provisions. The jobs are gone.</li>
<li>Illegal immigrants will be deported in larger numbers, but Trump will not send home a million children.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p>As of November 2016, Trump has already started to walk back several of these promises.</p>

<p>2017-Jan&#8211;20:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>During five hours of contentious questioning, Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee pressed Mr. Mnuchin to explain how he could fail to disclose $95 million of real estate assets, including property in New York, Los Angeles and Mexico, on his initial committee ethics questionnaire. &#8230; The former Goldman Sachs banker also did not initially disclose that he is the director of Dune Capital International, an investment fund incorporated on the Cayman Islands, an offshore tax haven.</p>

<p>Mr. Trump’s pick to be White House budget director, Representative Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, admitted paying back taxes of more than $15,000 for a household employee whose payroll taxes he had not paid, and his choice for health secretary, Representative Tom Price of Georgia, spent much of his confirmation hearing defending stock trades that might have been impacted by his legislating.</p>

<p>Three Democratic senators on Thursday sent a letter to Mr. Mnuchin about reports that Anthony Scaramucci, a wealthy financier whom Mr. Trump appointed to be White House director of engagement and intergovernmental affairs, was holding talks with the head of the sanctioned Russian investment fund at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week. The Russian fund has been under Treasury Department sanctions since 2015. &#8211; All from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/us/politics/steven-mnuchin-treasury-confirmation-hearing.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=span-abc-region&amp;region=span-abc-region&amp;WT.nav=span-abc-region">New York Times</a></p>
