<h1 id="predictionsforthetrumppresidency">Predictions for the Trump Presidency</h1>

<p>November 8, 2016 was a very bad day for the Republican Party. It likely ended the political careers of all current major Republican players (Ryan, McConnell, &#8230;).</p>

<p>Here are my predictions for the Trump Presidency (as of Nov&#8211;12, 2016):</p>

<ol>
<li>It will be <strong>short</strong>.
I expect Republicans to lose the Senate in 2018 and I expect them to lose big time in 2020.
The reason is that the current Trump coalition cannot be repeated. The coalition consists of angry voters who <a href="trump_voters.html">form their beliefs based on prejudice</a>, disregarding the evidence. In 2020, these people will still be angry, but then Trump will have been in power for four years.
The risk is that these voters have essentially fixed beliefs. Even if Trump turns out to be the worse president in history, it may not affect their views at all.</li>
<li>There will be a trickle of embarrassments and <strong>scandals</strong>.
I expect revelations of Trump&#8217;s past to keep coming in. There could be lawsuits. There will of course be major policy mistakes. There will be cover-ups. There may even be politically motivated investigations of opposition figures (Guiliani for Attorney General?).</li>
<li>Trump will attempt to massively extend the reach of the executive branch.</li>
<li>There will be political <strong>pressure on the justice department</strong> and Federal law enforcement agencies. Scandals need to be suppressed. Opposition investigations will be created. FBI director Comy decided the 2016 election. This will be attempted again.

<ol>
<li>May&#8211;2017: FBI directory Comey is fired because of his investigation of Russian ties and after he was asked to back down on that investigation.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>There will be constant criticism by experts and the press.
Uniquely, pretty much all of Trump&#8217;s major positions are pretty much unamimously opposed by experts and the press.</li>
<li>There will be big <strong>fiscal deficits</strong>.
Trump wants to be popular, so he will hand out goodies to voters. He also likes tax cuts. Trump will engineer an economic expansion near the 2020 election to boost his reelection chances.</li>
<li>Trump will fulfill all of his major <strong>campaign promises</strong>, but only cosmetically.

<ol>
<li>Obamacare will be repealed and replaced with a &#8220;new&#8221; program that keeps Obamacare&#8217;s key features (universal coverage independent of employment, coverage of pre-existing conditions). One might call this &#8220;repeal and rename.&#8221;

<ol>
<li>May 2017: This turned out to be more complicated. Trump tried to keep most major provisions, but the far right Republicans did not let him.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>The wall on the Mexican border will not be built. But there will be a few sections, so Trump can claim he kept his promise.</li>
<li>Nafta will be cosmetically renegotiated. Of course, it no longer make sense to reverse its key provisions. The jobs are gone.

<ol>
<li>Jan 2019: This turned out to be largely correct.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Illegal immigrants will be deported in larger numbers, but Trump will not send home a million children.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Jan 2019: There will be <strong>war with Iran</strong>.

<ol>
<li>I was wrong about Trump not running for reelection. Given that Trump is unpopular and his policies are a disaster, how does he plan to win?</li>
<li>I think that he is setting himself up for the good old trick of creating a foreign policy crisis; ideally a shooting war. For this to work, he needs a credible enemy. The only plausible candidates are North Korea and Iran. North Korea is too risky because of Nuclear Weapons. Kim also gave Trump an alternative through &#8220;successful&#8221; negotations. That leaves Iran.</li>
<li>This reasoning would explain why Trump is to consistently bad mouthing Iran. And why he is pulling out of the Iran Nuclear deal. And why Iran is always called the bad guy in any foreign policy crisis (e.g., Syria). The long term goal is to set up the U.S. population for a war with Iran.</li>
<li>Indirect support for my prediction from this <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/13/us/politics/bolton-iran-pentagon.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage">NY Times article</a></li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p>As of November 2016, Trump has already started to walk back several of these promises.</p>

<h2 id="scandalupdates">Scandal Updates</h2>

<p>2017-Feb&#8211;2:</p>

<p>It appears that I was too optimistic. I failed to predict that Trump has surrounded himself by people without any policy or diplomatic experience (special advisor, secretarys of state, defense, homeland security, UN ambassador, etc). The result: the implementation of the various policies is simply bungled because nobody in the White House bothers to consult the experts on the subject.</p>

<p>Recent examples: the executive order on immigration; confrontations with Mexico and Australia.</p>

<p>2017-Jan&#8211;20:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>During five hours of contentious questioning, Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee pressed Mr. Mnuchin to explain how he could fail to disclose $95 million of real estate assets, including property in New York, Los Angeles and Mexico, on his initial committee ethics questionnaire. &#8230; The former Goldman Sachs banker also did not initially disclose that he is the director of Dune Capital International, an investment fund incorporated on the Cayman Islands, an offshore tax haven.</p>

<p>Mr. Trumpâ€™s pick to be White House budget director, Representative Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, admitted paying back taxes of more than $15,000 for a household employee whose payroll taxes he had not paid, and his choice for health secretary, Representative Tom Price of Georgia, spent much of his confirmation hearing defending stock trades that might have been impacted by his legislating.</p>

<p>Three Democratic senators on Thursday sent a letter to Mr. Mnuchin about reports that Anthony Scaramucci, a wealthy financier whom Mr. Trump appointed to be White House director of engagement and intergovernmental affairs, was holding talks with the head of the sanctioned Russian investment fund at the World Economic Forum in Davos this week. The Russian fund has been under Treasury Department sanctions since 2015. &#8211; All from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/us/politics/steven-mnuchin-treasury-confirmation-hearing.html?action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;clickSource=story-heading&amp;module=span-abc-region&amp;region=span-abc-region&amp;WT.nav=span-abc-region">New York Times</a></p>
</blockquote>

<h1 id="updatemay2017">Update May 2017</h1>

<p>I expect Trump to resign before the 2020 election. He will pass a few major pieces of legislation (Obamacare repeal, tax reform). At this point, Trump can convince himself (and claim to posteriority) that he has accomplished what he promised. He will then invoke &#8220;health reasons&#8221; to resign. He will blame the liberal media for inflicting these health issues on him through their constant criticism.</p>

<p>Trump is under constant attack from all sides. There are multiple scandals a week. This will eventually take its toll. Voters will just get tired of it. Trump will realize that he cannot win reelection. He will also just want to get out of this mess. He had a great life before becoming president. Now he has achieved the presidency. He has won. That&#8217;s all that matters to him. He will want to go back to a better life. And he will want to avoid losing the election (perhaps even 2018). The face saving way of doing this is to resign for health reasons. He is, after all, in his 70s.</p>

<p>Update 2017-Aug: More likely than health reasons: Trump will simply claim that he has achieved everything he wanted in his first term and that he simply does not need a second term to right the country. He will point to trade reform (exiting TPA, renegotiation NAFTA), millions of new jobs, a firmly conservative Supreme Court, immigration policies that reduce illegal immigration, and something great about the military.</p>

<h1 id="update2020-april">Update 2020-April</h1>

<p>Well, I was obviously way too optimistic back in 2016 and 2017.</p>

<p>Yes, there were scandals, mistakes, embarassements, lawsuits, and big fiscal deficts. But none of this affected Trump&#8217;s approval ratings one bit. It is hard to see how this is not the end of democracy in the U.S.</p>

<p>What I did not expect was that Trump would simply turn out to be senile. His response to the Covid&#8211;19 crisis is absolutely incoherent. He goes down rabbit holes that no sane person would ever mention. The clearest example is Trump&#8217;s very serious consideration to ingest light (how does one do that?) or disinfectants to kill the Coronavirus. </p>

<p>Thanks to Trump&#8217;s &#8220;leadership,&#8221; the federal governemtn, especially the CDC, has done pretty much nothing to make testing widely available, to validate Covid tests (as was just started by private researchers), to contact trace (700 tracers for the entire U.S.??), or to procure PPE (as of today, the VA still says that it is short of PPE and operates in emergency mode). Even Trump voters will not put up with this level of catastrophe for long.</p>
