## Computer Code

[Notes on the Julia language](julia_notes.pdf). The purpose is to document solutions that I could not find in the Julia documentation. Updated periodically.

My [github repo](https://github.com/hendri54) contains code for recent projects.

The [shared repo](https://github.com/hendri54/shared) contains general purpose Matlab code.

Making this code available is a small attempt at reducing duplication, given that [economics lacks a code archive](thoughts/duplication.html).

Feel free to use my code in your research (with attribution, where appropriate).
