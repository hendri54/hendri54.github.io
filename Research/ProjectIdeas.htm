			<h1>Mainstream Macro</h1>
			<h3><strong>Cohort size and asset prices (10/2001)</strong></h3>
			<p>In the data, price-earnings ratio are closely related to the fraction
        of young households in the population. Geneakoplos, Magill and Quinzii
        (2001) ask whether this is consistent with rational expectations in
        spite of the fact that it implies substantial predictability of stock
        returns. Their model is a 3 period olg endowment economy. They find that
        the model is consistent with the data.</p>
			<p>It would be interesting to ask whether this finding survives in a
        world with capital accumulation and shorter period lengths. When old
        agents realize that young cohorts are getting smaller, they should
        decumulate capital (stock buybacks; higher dividends), which might
        substantially weaken stock market predictability. Does it matter that a
        small fraction of households hold nearly all financial wealth?</p>
			<h3>Does income inequality lead to consumption inequality? (10/2001)</h3>
			<p>Krueger and Perri (2001) point out a striking observation: since the
        1980s income inequality has increased a lot, but consumption inequality
        has not. They propose an explanation along the lines of Kehoe and
        Levine: more income risk losens the IR constraints in credit markets,
        borrowing constraints are relaxed, and consumption inequality remains
        low relative to income inequality.</p>
			<p>It would be interesting to look at the data more closely. What
        happens to the retired who should not be affected by changing income
        inequality? What happens to the wealth rich for whom borrowing
        constraints should not bind? To what extent did consumption inequality
        change within groups (education/age classes, for example)? Could one
        figure out from panel data how households finance consumption in low
        income states? How did that change since 1980?</p>
			<p>It would also be interesting to think of alternative explanations or
        extensions of the theory. An OLG model should generate implications for
        consumption inequality of young versus old households. Are these
        consistent with data?</p>
			<h3><strong>The Welfare Costs of Public Debt (10/2000)</strong></h3>
			<p>As far as I can see, little is known about the welfare costs of
        public debt. Is it very costly to deviate from the optimal debt level?
        (Aiyagari and McGrattan look at that question in their JME paper). This
        seems like a question of first-order importance that could be answered
        with fairly standard tools. Of course, I might simply not be aware of
        existing results (if so, please send me references).</p>
			<p>A paper related to the question is Bullard and Russel's working paper
        on the welfare cost of inflation. They find large welfare costs of
        inflation, but the same would seem to hold for other policies involving
        changes in public debt.</p>
			<h3><strong>Fiscal Policies in an Open Economy (4/2000)</strong></h3>
			<p>Mendoza (1998 AER) studies fiscal policies in an open economy. The approach is
        straightforward: Write down a standard growth model and compute the solution.</p>
			<p>What happens to these results if there is human capital and the economy is populated by
        overlapping generations instead of infinitely lived dynasties?</p>
			<h3><strong>Welfare costs of business cycles (6/99)</strong></h3>
			<p>Theory suggests that people should not care about recessions -- the welfare costs are
        tiny. Some observations suggest that this is not true empirically. For example, elections
        are sometimes lost because of recent recessions.</p>
			<p>How can we get people to care enough? What are our models missing?</p>

			<h1>Household Behavior</h1>
			<h2>Data on intergenerational transfers (6/99)</h2>
			<p>Intergenerational transfers are poorly understood. One reason: existing studies look at
        one type of transfer in isolation (bequests, inter vivos transfers). The trouble is: that
        is only the tip of the iceberg. Financial transfers are probably much smaller than
        non-financial ones. </p>
			<p>It may be possible to develop a dataset from the PSID that is more comprehensive. The
        1988 supplement contains detailed data on financial transfers. By matching children with
        their parents' records, one could measure education expenditures and coresidence.</p>
			<p>Question: What determines the total level of transfers? What determines the
        composition?</p>
			<p>This would be a messy project, but with a potentially very large payoff.</p>
			<p>A related question: Do children who work hard or run businesses receive larger
        transfers? This could be evidence for paternalistic behavior.

			<h1>Human capital</h1>
			<h2>Why did schooling stop rising in 1950? (10/08)</h2>
			<p>U.S. educational attainment rose smoothly from at least 1900 to 1950. 
		Then it stopped rising. Why?</p><h2>Taxation with risky human capital (6/01)</h2>
			<p>A large literature studies how human capital responds to taxation.
        Almost all of this literature abstracts from most uncertainty (about
        earnings etc.). It seems obvious that this abstraction should lead to
        overstated tax effects (use the intuition from portfolio choice). It
        would be useful to quantify how large that bias is. This would require
        embedding realistic earnings uncertainty into a standard life-cycle
        model with schooling and job-training. It would also be nice to have
        some analytical results about the effect of uncertainty on tax
        elasticities in simpler models.</p>
			<p>A word of caution: There are a couple of papers looking at human
        capital under uncertainty, though it seems nobody has looked at this
        particular question. This needs to be checked, though.</p>
			<h2>Why is schooling lumpy? (12/07)</h2>
			<p>In virtually all theories of human capital, years of schooling are a 
		continuous choice. In the data, the choice is lumpy (high school 
		graduate or dropout). Why is schooling lumpy? Why is there a big 
		(presumably permanent) earnings penalty for dropping out of college 
		after 3 years with a good GPA? What can be learned about how human 
		capital is produced and valued in the market?</p>
			<p>Does this have to do with the fact that grades are a noisy signal of 
		ability? Why is grade completion a better signal?</p></td>

			<h1>Macro-Labor</h1>
			<h2>Measuring the return to experience (8/08)</h2>
			<p>Experience as it is typically measured (age - school - 6) is 
		collinear with birth year and date. This makes it impossible to identify 
		the returns to experience. As wages grow over the life-cycle, it is 
		impossible to tell whether this is due to rising cohort quality, wages, 
		or experience.</p>
			<p>One could use a dataset that has actual measures of experience to 
		solve that problem. The idea would be to observe people of the same 
		birth cohort at the same date with different experience. But the 
		variation in experience needs to be instrumented. One possibility: use 
		birth month. Those who are born too late in the year may enter school a 
		year later than those who are born a bit earlier in the year. Perhaps 
		one could use the NLSY for this.</p>
			<h2>Rethinking labor supply (6/99)</h2>
			<p>It seems that lots of people <i>want</i> to work (why else would you be a grad
        student?). There is plenty of informal evidence. What implications does that have?</p></td>

			<h1>Growth/Development</h1>
			<h2>Why do democracies make bad policy choices? (2/09)</h2>
			<p>It seems puzzling that voters persistently approve bad policy 
			proposals (farm subsidies, industry protection, etc). Could one 
			consistently tell the following story: Voters are rationally 
			uninformed. They know about proposals that affect them a lot (why?) 
			but not about others. Then the winning policy plan loads up on pork 
			barrel spending and other goodies that lower welfare for the 
			majority of voters.</p>
			<p>This raises the interesting (unexplored?) question: how does 
			information get provided to voters? Since they are not interested in 
			acquiring it, information must be free. What kinds of biases does 
			this introduce into the political process. Are institutions for info 
			dissemination important for outcomes?<br>
</p>
			<h2>Which industries are productive in LDCs? (7/99)</h2>
			<p>The variance of productivities is very high in LDCs. Perhaps we could learn something
        about the obstacles to development by studying which industries are highly productive in
        LDCs. How are the findings related to predictions of standard models?</p>
			<p>Is a standard human capital model consistent with large industry TFP differentials?</p>
			<p>It looks like Herrendorf and Valentiny may have an answer to this 
			question.</p>
			<h2>Informal firms (2/09)</h2>
			<p>La Porta and Shleifer (2008) present some interesting evidence on 
			the differences between informal and formal sector firms (that are 
			registered with a central government authority). They push for an 
			interpretation of their findings. But the connection between data 
			(correlations) and interpretation is tenuous.</p>
			<p>It could be interesting to write down a model that nests the 
			competing hypotheses about why informal firms exist. Could one 
			distinguish the hypotheses with the available data? What are the 
			welfare implications of proposals to promote or discourage informal 
			sector firms?</p>

			<h1>International Migration</h1>
			<h2>What Do People Embody? (8/00)</h2>
			<p>Chris Carroll (1999 Econ Dev &amp; Cult Change) asks: are differences in saving rates
        across countries due to "culture"? To answer the question, he compares saving
        rates of U.S. immigrants with source country saving rates. There is no correlation. He
        concludes that culture is not the reason for cross-country differences.</p>
			<p>The argument about "culture" seems to be a bit of a misnomer. But the idea is
        sensible: immigrant data might allow us to identify which characteristics (propensity to
        save, to work hard, ...) are embodied in people and which characteristics arise as a
        response of fundamentally identical people to different environments.</p>
			<p>One example: Women's labor force participation differs a lot across countries and over
        time. Comparing immigrants and natives might shed light on the extent to which, for
        example, the increase in U.S. labor force participation reflects a change in social norms
        as opposed to a change in relative prices.
