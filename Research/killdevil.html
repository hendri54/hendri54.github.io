<h1 id="usingkilldevilatunc">Using Killdevil at UNC</h1>

<p>It is easiest to replicate the local directory structure on <code>killdevil</code>. Then running files on the cluster just requires a change in the base directory that all other directories hang off.</p>

<p>Write your code so that the data are placed in the right folder (different on unix cluster vs local machine).</p>

<p>Write a matlab function that does the computations and can be called from the command line.</p>

<p>Command syntax:
bsub -n 8 -R &#8220;span[hosts=1]&#8221; matlab -nodisplay -nosplash -r &#8220;run_batch_so1(&#8216;fminsearch&#8217;,1,1,7)&#8221; -logfile set7.out
-n 8 : requests 8 cores - the max matlab can handle</p>

<p><code>run_batch_so1</code> is my command file in this example.</p>

<p>Kure jobs crash regularly. It is important to make sure the optimization algorithm can hot-start (resume after a crash using a saved history).</p>

<h2 id="matlabissues">Matlab Issues</h2>

<p>Matlab is stuck in 2013 on all of UNC&#8217;s unix clusters (as of 2016-Aug). It is therefore basically no longer usable.</p>

<p>Update: We now have <code>Longleaf</code> with newer Matlab versions.</p>

<p>Saving files:</p>

<ul>
<li>Matlab cannot save large / complex files. It crashes. Only save the minimum optimization history needed to hot-start.</li>
<li>When using parallel algorithms, make sure different instances do not try to read / write the same file at the same time. A simple semaphore approach is easily implemented (each instance locks the file it wants to access by writing a file, e.g. &#8220;lock07_param.mat&#8221; indicates that instance 7 has locked the file param.mat).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="uploadingfiles">Uploading Files</h2>

<p>It is easiest to mount the <code>killdevil</code> home directory as a drive. Then use <code>rsync</code> to upload and download files.</p>

<p>Note for <code>MacOS</code> users: This does not work with the pre-installed version of <code>rsync</code> (as of Nov 2016). You need to install a newer version. The easiest way to do so is <code>MacPorts</code>.</p>
