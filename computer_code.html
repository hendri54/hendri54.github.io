<p><a href="julia_notes.pdf">Notes on the Julia language</a>. The purpose is to document solutions that I could not find in the Julia documentation. Updated periodically.</p>

<p>My <a href="https://github.com/hendri54">github repo</a> contains code for recent projects.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/hendri54/shared">shared repo</a> contains general purpose Matlab code.</p>

<p>Making this code available is a small attempt at reducing duplication, given that <a href="thoughts/duplication.html">economics lacks a code archive</a>.</p>

<p>Feel free to use my code in your research (with attribution, where appropriate).</p>
