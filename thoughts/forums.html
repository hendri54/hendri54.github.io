<h1 id="economicsdiscussionforums">Economics Discussion Forums</h1>

<p>2020-Aug&#8211;9</p>

<p>Wouldn&#8217;t it be nice if there were a place where economists can pose questions and get help from other economists?</p>

<p>Wouldn&#8217;t that be very helpful for undergraduate and graduate students who are trying to learn economics? But also for researchers who look for data sources, references, methods, &#8230;?</p>

<p>For software, online forums of this kind are commonplace. Even experience programmers consult them all the time. For learning new languages, they are essential. </p>

<p>Economics needs its own discussion forum. </p>

<p>For this to work, the forum must require registration. Posts cannot be anonymous. The discussion must be moderated. Otherwise, we end up with another facebook or twitter.</p>

<p>Here are the forums that I know about:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.aeaweb.org/forum/">EconSpark</a></li>
<li>organized by the AEA</li>
<li>registration required, moderated</li>
<li>volume is currently quite low</li>
<li><a href="https://economics.stackexchange.com/">Econ StackExchange</a></li>
<li>currently listed as &#8220;beta&#8221;</li>
<li>registration required, moderated</li>
<li>focused on Q&amp;A, not discussion</li>
<li>there is reasonable volume, but questions and answers tend to be basic</li>
</ul>

<p>I found that <a href="https://www.debate.org/forums/economics/">Debate.org</a> is overrun by spam.</p>

<p>It seems to me that StackExchange could be the place to pose specific questions and EconSpark could be the place for more open ended conversations.</p>

<p>I propose that we all point our students to those two forums to get some volume going. </p>
