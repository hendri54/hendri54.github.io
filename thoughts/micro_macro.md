# Micro Versus Macro #

Why do macro models look so different from micro models?

A caricature: 

* A macro model:
	* Has 7 parameters which are calibrated to match 7 data moments.
	* Has decision rules that only depend on a few state variables.
* A micro model:
	* Has 700 parameters which are estimated so that the model replicates the complete life histories of everyone in a dataset. 
	* All decisions a person ever makes in life are modeled. 
	* There are preference shocks everywhere. 
	* Decision rules depend on everything the researcher can observe.

Why do researchers in the same profession, often studying the same question, write down models that look so different?

I think the answer is that applied micro economists view models very differently from macro economists. 

In macro, a model is a [proof of concept](quantitative_models.html). It is a reasonable model with reasonable parameters that demonstrates that a particular mechanism **can be big**.

In micro, a model is a close approximation of the true data generating process (that's why there is so much emphasis on hypothesis testing). The quantitative answers are taken seriously.
