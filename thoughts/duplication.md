# Thoughts on How Economists Can Avoid Reinventing the Wheel #

### The Problem ###

In writing research papers, economists solve the same problems over and over again.

**Code Examples**

* Drawing joint Normal random variables with fixed standard deviations (e.g. agents' endowments).
* Coding common production functions (nested CES).

**Data Examples**

* Constructing individual histories of earnings / schooling using NLSY / PSID data.
* Consistently constructing measures of schooling / earnings across year in CPS / Census / ACS data.

The list is endless.

### The Solution ###

Consider what other disciplines do.

People who work on numerical math have access to a set of trusted code libraries (BLAS, NLopt, ...).

There is a mechanism through which users can contribute to code ([github](github.com)) or discuss it (e.g., [stackexchange](stackexchange.com)).

Consider the development of the [Julia language](julialang.org). 

* All the code libraries live on [github](github.com).
* The major packages are moderated by groups who take responsibility for the code's correctness.
* All code comes with automated tests.

The result: Much of the time when users ask questions on how to solve a problem in `Julia`, someone will simply point to an existing library.

Economics needs a similar setup for code and for data.

Instead of creating the same variables over and over again from each of the major datasets, there should be a place where the construction of such variables can be discussed and where code for constructing variables can be posted (and trusted).

### The Organizational Problem ###

Why does this not happen?[^QuantEconFn]

Because there is no payoff for individuals to run such an effort.

Can this problem be solved?

As a small first step, I have started to post reusable code I wrote at [github](https://github.com/hendri54).
