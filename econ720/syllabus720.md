# Econ720: Advanced Macroeconomic Theory (PhD)

### [%ClassTerm]. Prof. Lutz Hendricks. UNC

-----------------

## Course objective:

Econ720 is the first course in the macro PhD sequence. Its objective is to teach basic versions of the standard models commonly used in macroeconomics. In parallel, the course develops the mathematical methods used to characterize the equilibria of the models. 

This is a largely a theory and methods course. But we will cover some applications to topics such as the distribution of wealth. The course schedule contains more detail.

## Organization:

* Two lectures per week: MW, room and time to be announced
* Recitation: Fri room and time to be announced
* TA: Yanran Guo, office hours TBA
* Course website: [lhendricks.org/econ720/econ720.html](lhendricks.org/econ720/econ720.html)
* Sakai site: [https://sakai.unc.edu/portal/site/econ720](https://sakai.unc.edu/portal/site/econ720)

## Grading:

* Midterm: 40%. Final: 50%. Problem sets: 10%. Exams are closed book and cover all material taught.
* Review problems are for your practice and not to be turned in. Many are questions from previous exams.
* If a student misses a midterm, the weight of that midterm in the course grade will be added to the weight on the student’s final.  An exception will be made for [University-approved absences](http://catalog.unc.edu/policies-procedures/attendance-grading-examination/). Students with this type of absence may request a make-up examination at a time convenient to both student and instructor.

## Special Arrangements for 2020:

UNC has decided that the course will be taught in "hybrid-flex" format. There will be in person class meetings as usual. Class meetings will also be streamed live on `zoom` and recorded for later viewing by students in difficult time zones.

During class, I will screen share the slides on my laptop, which are also projected on the projector screen in the classroom. I will ask one student to keep an eye on questions that come in via `zoom`, either by chat or using the raised hand feature.

For safety reasons, I will not stay after class for questions or discussions. Office hours will be held online. I will hold scheduled office hours (as required by UNC), even though I have always found them useless (`n` students show up at the same time with `n-1` students waiting for the first to finish their discussion). I encourage everyone to make appointments instead. I also plan to set up forums on `sakai` so that discussions among students and with me can occur asynchronously.

Given that COVID cases are on the rise, it is likely that the course will switch to online only after the first few weeks. This is out of my control.

It is also likely that the exams will switch to online. In that case, exams will be open book.

Students who attend in person must wear masks and observe social distancing. No exceptions. Even so, meeting in person is dangerous and I will not force students who do not feel safe to attend in person.

Problem sets must be scanned and submitted electronically (probably by email).

## Rules:

* Questions and comments are always welcome.
* You should download the slides before each class. However, I tend to change details even after posting the slides.
