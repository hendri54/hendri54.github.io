# Tips for Presenting a Paper

## Intro

Clearly state: 

* what is the question? (this should be one of your first slides) 
* how is it approached? 
* why is the approach reasonable? 
* what are the findings? 
* how does the paper change the way I think about economics? (due to Lee Ohanian).

After the intro, people must have the paper's main message firmly in their minds.

## Slides

Don't put too much on a slide. The Pat Kehoe test is useful: drop the slide on the floor; can you still read everything?

Every slides must have a point. It must state its point clearly.

You should have no more than 30 slides for a 90 minute presentation, unless there is very little on each slide.
