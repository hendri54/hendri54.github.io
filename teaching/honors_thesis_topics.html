<h1 id="someideasfordissertationprojects">Some Ideas for Dissertation Projects</h1>

<p>This page contains a collection of ideas that may be useful starting points for honors theses.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: I haven&#8217;t thought about these ideas carefully, so they may not be good ideas. Or they may have been done (note the date next to each idea). Or they may not be doable. Or boring, or fundamentally mistaken, or any of the other things that tend to derail research projects.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t take the ideas as given. Use them to get started thinking about a set of questions.</p>

<h1 id="college">College</h1>

<h2 id="collegestratification">College Stratification</h2>

<p>Hoxby (2009) shows that colleges became more stratified in the 1960s. Her data end in 2006. They are also not publicly available. </p>

<p>Moreover, Hoxby&#8217;s data show that initially highly selective colleges became more selective over time and vice versa. A different, but related, question is: did colleges become more homogeneous? How did the CDF of college &#8220;qualities&#8221; change over time? What happened more recently?</p>

<p>Possible data sources: IPEDS (since about 1985) and HERI freshmen surveys.</p>

<h1 id="cross-countryincomedifferences">Cross-country Income Differences</h1>

<h2 id="doimmigrantearningsrisewithsourcecountrygdp">Do immigrant earnings rise with source country GDP?</h2>

<p>But see JOEG 2018/139.</p>

<h2 id="occupationaldowngradingofimmigrants2020">Occupational downgrading of immigrants (2020)</h2>

<p>Idea: If immigrants from poor countries have less hc (given schooling), they should be employed in jobs that require less hc. Those are jobs held by natives with lower schooling.</p>

<p>Quantify this:</p>

<p>Construct avg native schooling by [occupation, industry].</p>

<p>For each source/host pair: compute the average gap between immigrant and native schooling in [occ, ind] cells. This is a measure of occupational downgrading.</p>

<p>To what extent is the wage gap between immigrants and similar natives explained by this?</p>

<p>Jones (2014) has strong claims about downgrading. How do those hold up? </p>

<h2 id="thetaskcontentofimmigrantjobs2020">The task content of immigrant jobs (2020)</h2>

<p>Todd Schoellman may have done this.</p>

<h1 id="inequality">Inequality</h1>

<h2 id="howimportantareinheritances2020">How important are inheritances (2020)</h2>

<p>Using the SCF, calculate the fraction of wealth inherited by the rich.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/how-does-intergenerational-wealth-transmission-affect-wealth-concentration-20180601.htm">Feiveson and Sabelhaus 2018</a> do something like this. They conclude that the rich likely inherit a large fraction of their wealth. Those calculations are quite sensitive to the assumed real interest rates.</p>

<h2 id="howpredictablearelifetimeearnings2020">How predictable are lifetime earnings? (2020)</h2>

<p>It is fairly easy to get a lower bound on predictability. Take a panel dataset. Use half to fit a statistical model. Use the other half to perform out of sample prediction.</p>

<p>Specification search is a problem.</p>

<h2 id="skillpremiumvariationacrossu.s.statescities">Skill premium variation across U.S. states / cities</h2>

<p>Dispersion supposedly has decreased. Could one explore empirically possible explanations?</p>

<p>This is very open ended without a clear hypothesis or method.</p>

<p>See Marey &#8220;shifts and twists in the relative productivity of skilled labor&#8221;</p>
