# How can undergraduates get involved in research?

The main organized path for undergraduate research in economics is the [senior honors thesis](../honors/intro.html).

Aside from the honors thesis, students need to approach faculty members directly and inquire whether they can work on one of the faculty members' projects. This works best if the faculty member already knows the student.

For help with this process, please contact the undergraduate research liasion (the economics front office will know who this is at any given time). Also see the notes provided by [OUR](https://our.unc.edu/opportunities-and-courses/find-a-research-opportunity/)

## Summer research fellowships

* [Mayo Summer Research Fellowship for macro](https://econ.unc.edu/the-hubert-brown-mayo-award-for-summer-research/) 
* [SURF](https://our.unc.edu/surf/) Summer University Research Fellowships
* Guest Summer Research Fellowship for micro.  

These are announced in late fall, with applications due in March.  

An additional option is the University work-study program.
