Talk to me if any of these sound interesting. Disclaimer : I haven't thought about these ideas carefully, so they may not be good ideas. Or they may have been done (note the date next to each idea). Or they may not be doable. Or boring, or fundamentally mistaken, or any of the other things that tend to derail research projects. Don't take the ideas as given. Use them to get started thinking about a set of questions. Some general tips for getting started with a dissertation are here . Human Capital Why did schooling stop rising in 1950? (10/08) U.S. educational attainment rose smoothly from at least 1900 to 1950. Then it stopped rising. Why? And why did schooling rise in the first place (some recent papers offer answers, but do I believe them?)? The Ag/Non-Ag or Urban-Rural Wage Gap ## (2015-05) Wages in non-ag are double those in ag. Wages in cities are higher than in villages (by how much?). Some papers suggest reasons. For example, Lagakos and Waugh (2013 AER) argue that selection is important. But nobody seems to use much data to study these questions. To me, this calls for panel data. One could observe the wage changes as a given person migrates from ag to non-ag. Taxation with risky human capital (6/01) A large literature studies how human capital responds to taxation. Almost all of this literature abstracts from most uncertainty (about earnings etc.). It seems obvious that this abstraction should lead to overstated tax effects (use the intuition from portfolio choice). It would be useful to quantify how large that bias is. This would require embedding realistic earnings uncertainty into a standard life-cycle model with schooling and job-training. It would also be nice to have some analytical results about the effect of uncertainty on tax elasticities in simpler models. A word of caution: There are a couple of papers looking at human capital under uncertainty, though it seems nobody has looked at this particular question. This needs to be checked, though. Why is schooling lumpy? (12/07) In virtually all theories of human capital, years of schooling are a continuous choice. In the data, the choice is lumpy (high school graduate or dropout). Why is schooling lumpy? Why is there a big (presumably permanent) earnings penalty for dropping out of college after 3 years with a good GPA? What can be learned about how human capital is produced and valued in the market? Does this have to do with the fact that grades are a noisy signal of ability? Why is grade completion a better signal?","title":"Project ideas"},{"location":"Research/project_ideas.html#some-ideas-for-dissertation-projects","text":"This page contains a collection of ideas that may be useful for getting started on dissertation research.

Prof. Lutz Hendricks. UNC Course objective: Econ720 is the first course in the macro PhD sequence. Its objective is to teach basic versions of the standard models commonly used in macroeconomics. In parallel, the course develops the mathematical methods used to characterize the equilibria of the models. This is a largely a theory and methods course. But we will cover some applications to topics such as the distribution of wealth. The course schedule contains more detail. Organization: Two lectures per week: MW 8:00 - 9:15, Greenlaw 101 Recitation: Fri 8:00 - 8:50, Dey Hall Toy Lounge 409 TA: Yanran Guo, office hours TBA Course website: lhendricks.org/econ720/econ720.html Sakai site: https://sakai.unc.edu/portal/site/econ720 Grading: Midterm: 40%. Final: 50%. Problem sets: 10%. Exams are closed book and cover all material taught. Per university requirement, the final will last 3 hours. Review problems are for your practice and not to be turned in. Many are questions from previous exams. If a student misses a midterm, the weight of that midterm in the course grade will be added to the weight on the student\u2019s final. An exception will be made for University-approved absences . Students with this type of absence may request a make-up examination at a time convenient to both student and instructor. Special Arrangements for 2020: UNC has decided that the course will be taught in \"hybrid-flex\" format. There will be in person class meetings as usual. Class meetings will also be streamed live on zoom and recorded for later viewing by students in difficult time zones. During class, I will screen share the slides on my laptop, which are also projected on the projector screen in the classroom. I will ask one student to keep an eye on questions that come in via zoom , either by chat or using the raised hand feature. For safety reasons, I will not stay after class for questions or discussions. Office hours will be held online. I will hold scheduled office hours (as required by UNC), even though I have always found them imperfect ( n students show up at the same time with n-1 students waiting for the first to finish their discussion). I encourage everyone to make appointments instead. I also set up forums on sakai so that discussions among students and with me can occur asynchronously. Given that COVID cases are on the rise, it is likely that the course will switch to online only after the first few weeks. This is out of my control.

I will ask one student to keep an eye on questions that come in via zoom , either by chat or using the raised hand feature. For safety reasons, I will not stay after class for questions or discussions. Office hours will be held online. I will hold scheduled office hours (as required by UNC), even though I have always found them imperfect ( n students show up at the same time with n-1 students waiting for the first to finish their discussion). I encourage everyone to make appointments instead. I also set up forums on sakai so that discussions among students and with me can occur asynchronously.

The organization would be similar to a reading group. I envision a few lectures to provide background material and review classic papers from the literature. But mainly student presentations that would be structured like discussions at a conference. The assumption would be that everyone has read the papers discussed in each class meeting (probably 4 papers a week). The presenters would offer insights into what makes each paper tick, what is compelling and what is not. Much of the time would be spent on simply discussing each paper. Over time, students would come up with project ideas. Once a promising idea is identified, each student develops it as far as possible. This would at least entail placing the idea into the context of the literature, identifying the contribution, and outlining a model. The end product would be a fully written up research proposal. In the past, this course covered computational methods as well. I have come to the conclusion that mixing these with the economic material is not productive.

Pick something that interests you and start reading. Let's use cross-country income gaps as an example. Rich countries are 25 times richer than poor countries. Why? Start reading. Take notes on what you read. Organize your notes, so you understand the \"tree of questions\" in that literature. In our example, part of the tree may look like this: How important are capital, human capital, and productivity? Within human capital: how that this be measured? Why does it differ across countries? Within the measurement question: there is a Mincerian approach and a production function approach. Questions there: how can we measure inputs to human capital production? How can we estimate a production function? The point is to get from vague, broad questions to specific questions that one could potentially study. Advisors Even a well posed question does not help you if you cannot find an advisor. Therefore, you need to focus on areas where someone on the faculty has expertise. At the very start of your search, you should visit the websites of faculty members in your field of interest and read some of their recent papers. This will give you an idea of the range of topics that you can get support for. It will also give you feel for the techniques that each faculty member uses (e.g., theory, econometrics, computational modeling). The best approach is to not look for a topic. Just sit down and try to understand how the literature answers a question of interest. Yes: a question ! Good project ideas end with a question mark. Be suspicious of ideas like \"we want to explore ...\" Be very suspcious about ideas like \"what happens when feature x is added to a model?\" You need a question. Anyway, at some point you'll get the idea of what others think about the question of interest (or even of what interesting questions in a given area may be). Then simply ask: \" Do I believe what I have read? Is it convincing? \" Forget the fact that you are looking for a project. Just ask whether you believe what you have read. You will typically find that there are many shaky issues in the proposed answers. That's where an idea is born. If you find something that is really unconvincing, it is an opportunity to do better. Example : You decide to study the question: \"How much does human capital differ across countries?\" The literature basically has two types of answers. Mincer equations: Regress log wages on schooling for U.S. workers. Assume that workers with given schooling have the same human capital in all countries. Estimate a schooling production function. Estimate schooling inputs for a set of countries. Calculate human capital from the production function. The Mincer approach is not credible because it must assume that workers with given schooling have the same human capital everywhere. The production function approach turns out to be very tricky. It is extremely hard to measure schooling inputs (parental time, school inputs, child study time, child abilities, peer effects, etc.) and outputs (adult wages?). The functional form of the school production function is unknown. This leads to two project ideas : Try to improve the estimation of human capital production functions. Look for better data (existing studies did not use individual data - this actually would be a good project which has not been done at the time I am writing this). Try to measure human capital without estimating a production function. How can this be done? If one could observe the productivity of workers from different countries, that would work. This leads to the idea: estimate the productivity of workers from country x as the wages earned by U.S. immigrants from that country (Hendricks 2002 AER). Of course, in most cases it will simply be too hard to do better. Then you don't believe that the existing findings are bullet proof, but they are still the best answers available. It is useful to keep these kinds of situations in the back of your mind. Perhaps you'll see something later that allows you to follow through with your idea after all. Example : The migration literature argues about immigrant quality and earnings of immigrants relative to natives. But it's very hard to figure out what's really going on in all the data because we don't have longitudinal observations. So there is a clear potential for improvement, but it's not feasible because the data don't exist. Write that down. Later on you find out about the German Socioeconomic Panel and the fact that it oversamples guestworkers. Perhaps one could use that data to address the open issues? (This is actually a project idea worth pursuing, not just a ficticious example. In fact, recently a number of papers using longitudinal immigrant data have come out in top journals.) Use common sense . A fair number of good ideas are obvious with hindsight. Example: A large literature has studied the causes of cross-country income gaps. Many hypotheses were investigated: human capital, organization capital, trade, etc. But common sense tells us that institutions are important. The obvious evidence comes from divided countries (East and West Germany) and from the former Soviet Block. Strangely, it took a very long time for this idea to be explored in economic research. One more suggestion: Work on a topic that at least one local faculty member knows in detail . Otherwise, it will be hard to convince your committee members to spend a lot of time on your project. And the comments you will receive may be far off the mark. Make a serious effort to demolish your ideas. What happens once you have found a candidate topic: Try to convince yourself that the idea is no good . This is important. Before you sink any time into an idea, make sure it is worth it. Most ideas are not worth anything. There are many reasons. Perhaps the idea is too marginal. But more commonly it is outright flawed. Make a list of objections against your idea. Be sure you know how to respond to them. Talk to people and ask them for objections. Do this early . Do not wait until you have a model or (worse) a paper draft. One objection could destroy the entire effort you put into the project. Such as: \"X has done that already in a 1955 paper\" or \"This does not make sense because of XYZ.\" Be sure to try simple examples first. They sometimes reveal fundamental flaws in an idea or question. Example: You want to argue that schooling accounts for large cross-country income gaps. You think about a model in which human capital depends on schooling according to h(s) = h(0) * g(s). A back of the envelope calculations that this cannot work. To generate income gaps of, say, a factor 10, you would need h(12)/h(2)=10 (U.S. versus Uganda). Then the return to schooling would have to be enormous. A similar advice applies to the implementation. You may have a good question, but not a good way of answering it. Don't forget common sense . A lot of papers go through sophisticated analysis of a model that just doesn't make common sense. Motivation, Ideas, and Lack Thereof A common problem with dissertation topics is lack of motivation or lack of an idea. I often see papers that extend existing work in minor ways without any good reason why that should be done. Often, these are extensions of field papers. Usually, these turn out to be a waste of time. Relaxing an assumption does not make a paper . You need to convince people that it matters to attack a question in a more general way. A paper needs an idea . It is easy to find good questions. It is hard to find good ideas. Do not waste time on a project until you have convinced yourself that the idea is worthwhile. A question is something broad like: \"How important are productivity shocks for business cycles?\" \"Why does education differ across countries?\" An idea is a specific approach to answering a question. Such as: Kydland & Prescott for the business cycle question. Before you start working on the details, you should be able to explain in non-technical terms why your idea has merit. If you can't do that, chances are your idea is not important. Depth Writing a good paper requires that you really understand the literature. You should read a lot and think a lot. See my comments on specialization. When you start reading about a subject, you will generate lots of ideas. Most of these are no good, but you won't be able to see this until you really understand the literature. Defer the Details I see a lot of students with half-baked ideas and fully worked out models. This is a waste of time. In most cases, don't write down a model until you can precisely state: What is the question? Why is it important? What is the approach? Why does the approach make sense? What is the potential punchline? To borrow from Lee Ohanian: How does your paper change the way I think about the world? How does it fit into the literature? This, by the way, makes a good template for an Introduction. You cannot know what ingredients your model needs to have, until you can answer these questions. To Plan or Not to Plan? Some people ask: \"what is your research agenda?\" Ideally one could answer: \"I want to understand this big picture question and here are the steps that will get me there ... At the end I should have the following papers ...\" If that works, great! It usually doesn't (take a look at Parente and Prescott Barriers to Riches for a great example where it did work). There are at least two reasons: Until you have actually done a step in the plan, you typically have no idea what will come out (especially if the work has any empirical content). But what comes next depends critically on what you found before. It is hard to come up with a good idea/question that can actually be done. It is darn hard to come up with a whole sequence of such ideas at a time. Therefore, be realistic and take project ideas one at a time. Think of each dissertation chapter as one publishable paper. Don't try to write a monolithic dissertation where one chapter leads cleanly to the next. It's perfectly fine if your chapters address different questions. Specialize! At any cost, avoid working on several unrelated problems. To be successful, you must specialize. Each time you work on a new topic, you incur the large fixed cost of really, deeply understanding the literature. It is therefore essential to zero in on one or two areas and then stick to those for several years. If you do not follow this advice, you will encounter two problems: Your papers will lack depth. They may look superficially interesting, but experts will view your papers as missing the point. When you try to publish your work, you will have to convince referees that you should be taken seriously. They need to know that you have published in the same area before. Aim to associate your name with a topic. If you work in many different areas, nobody will know who you are. But if you persistently work in one area, people will hear your name and immediately think: \"he/she works on X.\" This is how your work is taken seriously and how to get impact. Disclaimer: I am sure there are reasonable people who vehemently disagree with my views on this. Theory vs. Empirical Work Theory is glamorous and in many respects just more interesting and more fun to do than data work. If you doubt that, start reading the documentation for the PSID. Data work involves a lot of tedious steps and a lot of time during which essentially nothing is learned (except about the twisted minds of those who publish data sets). If you doubt that, start reading the documentation for the PSID. And yet, you should consider doing empirical work. For one simple reason: It may get you a job. There are loads of theorists coming out of top departments every year. The best of them get jobs. The others often have a hard time because the market for pure theory is not that large. Having an empirical project or at least a serious empirical part in your dissertation immensely increases the range of jobs you can apply for. There is unfortunately a big barrier standing between graduate students and data: Empirical work is hardly ever taught. The first time around, the startup investment required for using a data set is very large. If you doubt that, start reading the documentation for the PSID. Which is why many grad students never touch any data. But this obstacle can be overcome through persistence. Communicating with your committee members (CMs) Remember: your CMs don't think about your project all the time. They forget details between meetings. Therefore: Stay in touch regularly. Too many students show up with a completed paper that was written without any input from the CMs. They are then surprised when the CMs think that major revisions are needed. Have a short summary document ready. In particular, have a document with the model equations. Prepare for each meeting. Summarize your progress and the issues to be discussed in a short document. Documents should not be written in prose. Prose is a waste of time for the writer and for the reader. Use an outline format. Respond to comments. Do not just ignore them. Again, a short reply document is useful. Writing Early on, write out a plan for the paper It should address the items in the intro. Be clear about what results you may get and what the contribution would be. Until you can clearly state the potential contribution of the project, don't spend any time on it. Models are presented in a standard format: Describe demographics, preferences, endowments, technologies, market arrangements. State each agent's problem. Define an equilibrium. Only when all of this is done are you allowed to analyze the properties of the model. See also notes on writing . To Ph.D. or not to Ph.D.? Finally, a word for those who are considering whether or not to apply for a Ph.D. program: If you are not sure you want a Ph.D., do something else. The Ph.D. program is structured with a single outcome in mind: to place graduating students as faculty in Research I universities. The material learned is useful for only one purpose: for publishing research in academic journals. It is not useful for consulting, for working in businesses or the government (other than the Fed), or even for teaching. Therefore, if you are not sure you want to do academic research for the rest of your life, do not apply for Ph.D. programs in economics. An MA or an MBA always has a higher payoff and will save you years of frustration.","title":"Dissertation Tips #"},{"location":"graduate/dissertation_tips.html#dissertation-tips","text":"","title":"Dissertation Tips"},{"location":"graduate/dissertation_tips.html#finding-a-topic","text":"","title":"Finding a topic"},{"location":"graduate/dissertation_tips.html#work-top-down","text":"When you start out, you just don't know which questions are interesting, which have been answered, etc. So you start broadly. Pick something that interests you and start reading. Let's use cross-country income gaps as an example. Rich countries are 25 times richer than poor countries. Why? Start reading. Take notes on what you read. Organize your notes, so you understand the \"tree of questions\" in that literature. In our example, part of the tree may look like this: How important are capital, human capital, and productivity? Within human capital: how that this be measured? Why does it differ across countries? Within the measurement question: there is a Mincerian approach and a production function approach. Questions there: how can we measure inputs to human capital production? How can we estimate a production function? The point is to get from vague, broad questions to specific questions that one could potentially study.","title":"Work top down"},{"location":"graduate/dissertation_tips.html#advisors","text":"Even a well posed question does not help you if you cannot find an advisor. Therefore, you need to focus on areas where someone on the faculty has expertise. At the very start of your search, you should visit the websites of faculty members in your field of interest and read some of their recent papers. This will give you an idea of the range of topics that you can get support for. It will also give you feel for the techniques that each faculty member uses (e.g., theory, econometrics, computational modeling).","title":"Advisors"},{"location":"graduate/dissertation_tips.html#the-best-approach-is-to-not-look-for-a-topic","text":"Just sit down and try to understand how the literature answers a question of interest. Yes: a question ! Good project ideas end with a question mark. Be suspicious of ideas like \"we want to explore ...\" Be very suspcious about ideas like \"what happens when feature x is added to a model?\" You need a question. Anyway, at some point you'll get the idea of what others think about the question of interest (or even of what interesting questions in a given area may be). Then simply ask: \" Do I believe what I have read? Is it convincing? \" Forget the fact that you are looking for a project. Just ask whether you believe what you have read. You will typically find that there are many shaky issues in the proposed answers. That's where an idea is born. If you find something that is really unconvincing, it is an opportunity to do better. Example : You decide to study the question: \"How much does human capital differ across countries?\" The literature basically has two types of answers. Mincer equations: Regress log wages on schooling for U.S. workers. Assume that workers with given schooling have the same human capital in all countries. Estimate a schooling production function. Estimate schooling inputs for a set of countries. Calculate human capital from the production function. The Mincer approach is not credible because it must assume that workers with given schooling have the same human capital everywhere. The production function approach turns out to be very tricky. It is extremely hard to measure schooling inputs (parental time, school inputs, child study time, child abilities, peer effects, etc.) and outputs (adult wages?). The functional form of the school production function is unknown. This leads to two project ideas : Try to improve the estimation of human capital production functions. Look for better data (existing studies did not use individual data - this actually would be a good project which has not been done at the time I am writing this). Try to measure human capital without estimating a production function. How can this be done? If one could observe the productivity of workers from different countries, that would work. This leads to the idea: estimate the productivity of workers from country x as the wages earned by U.S. immigrants from that country (Hendricks 2002 AER). Of course, in most cases it will simply be too hard to do better. Then you don't believe that the existing findings are bullet proof, but they are still the best answers available. It is useful to keep these kinds of situations in the back of your mind. Perhaps you'll see something later that allows you to follow through with your idea after all. Example : The migration literature argues about immigrant quality and earnings of immigrants relative to natives. But it's very hard to figure out what's really going on in all the data because we don't have longitudinal observations. So there is a clear potential for improvement, but it's not feasible because the data don't exist. Write that down. Later on you find out about the German Socioeconomic Panel and the fact that it oversamples guestworkers. Perhaps one could use that data to address the open issues?

Structure of the presentation Separate the presentation of what you do from the discussion of why you do it. Brief comments mixed in with the model presentation are ok. Long discussions make it hard to follow what you actually do. Separate the presentation of the model from the derivation of its implications. It is very confusing to read a paper that mixes assumptions with results. First present the model. Define equilibrium. Then derive properties of the equilibrium. There is a standard structure for presenting a model : Demographics Endowments Preferences Technologies Market arrangements Only once these have been stated is it acceptable to talk about equilibrium properties or agents' problems. Next, describe the agents' problems, and define an equilibrium. Your introduction should answer the following questions (due to Lee Ohanian): What is the question to be answered? Why is it important? (Often obvious) How is it approached? Why is the approach reasonable? What is the main result? How does the paper change the way I think about economics? What is the contribution? What is new relative to the literature? The process of writing Nice wording comes last First decide on what you want to write. Just write that down. Focus on structure. Ignore wording and formatting. Only when everything is in place does it make sense to worry about construcing nice sentences. When you write a section, ask yourself: what is the message of this section? And then write the answer to that question as the section's intro sentence. Do not mix levels of abstraction (a rule borrowed from programming). When you discuss high level arguments (e.g. in the Introduction), do not mix in details. Think of your document as a nested list or an outline. There should be a place (the Intro) where the reader can get the entire story (minus detail) on about one page. Then think of each section as elaborating the details of the overall argument. Ideally, the reader should be able to read the level 2 sections (skipping the level 3s) and get the entire argument again, just with a bit more detail. The level 3 sections then provide even more detail. Each such section should by itself make a self-contained point. PS: I wish there was a technology for actually writing papers as nested, collapsible lists. Tips and tricks A little trick: When you are unsure about notation, define latex commands for the mathematical symbols. Example: \\newcommand{\\capShare}{\\alpha} . Then y = A k^\\capShare . Avoid literals in your text. Let your code write a latex preamble with statments like \\newcommand{\\meanWage}{7.53} . Then in the text: \"the mean wage in the sample is \\$\\meanWage\". That way, you don't have to manually update the numbers in the text. It's more robust. Tables Don't write tables by hand. Let your code write them. It's faster and it avoids mistakes. It is fairly easy to write basic Latex tables using code. I have Matlab code for this purpose in my github repo. Links Tips on Writing Economics Papers by R.

Why do researchers in the same profession, often studying the same question, write down models that look so different? I think the answer is that applied micro economists view models very differently from macro economists. In macro, a model is a proof of concept .

We (researchers) spend a rather large amount of time on structural models. Especially on getting quantitative answers out of them. Do the answers we get have much of an impact on what people believe about reality. I think the answer is \"no\". I am familiar with research on economic growth, cross-country income differences, and wealth distribution. Consider the basic questions from that literature. Why Are Some Countries Rich and Others Poor? Our current understanding seems alarmingly similar to that of 1996, when I got my degree. Capital is probably not important. I'm not sure we have a very good reason for believing this (see Caselli's JEL survey). Human capital: we don't know. Quantitative models are all over the place. Even if they weren't, I don't think anyone would take them very seriously. Immigrant earnings point in one direction (Hendricks 2002), but then maybe not (Hendricks and Schoellman 2016). TFP is probably important. But then we knew that back in the 1960s. Lots of research has changed beliefs very little. Why? Because we don't have clear evidence that we can interpret without a model. As for deep causes , most researchers probably believe that institutions are important. I would argue that this belief has not changed much over time. It has been supported by clever empirical papers (Acemoglu et al.). That work has changed beliefs. Notably, it is purely empirical, supported by a coherent historical narrative. Why Do Countries Grow? We don't really know anything about this. We like to write down \"R&D\" models, but that seems to have more to do with prejudice than with evidence. Is there any evidence to support that \"R&D\" is really what drives growth? It's probably true, but I say this because of my intuitive understanding of how the world works, not because of evidence. Why Do Some Households Hold Lots of Wealth? Here is a case where a model probably did change beliefs (Huggett 1996). I think this worked because households don't do very much in that model. We have a bunch of candidate solutions for generating high wealth holdings (inheritances and entrepreneurship are probably the leading candidates). How important these are is still not settled. Most researchers probably believe that entrepreneurship is important. But then this is somewhat obvious from looking at the data. I don't think that models did much to generate this belief. Implications If models don't change beliefs, then we are probably wasting a lot of time in macro research. Perhaps the old-fashioned approach of showing correlations (e.g., OLS regressions) and offering a coherent interpretation is underrated.

We have a bunch of candidate solutions for generating high wealth holdings (inheritances and entrepreneurship are probably the leading candidates). How important these are is still not settled. Most researchers probably believe that entrepreneurship is important. But then this is somewhat obvious from looking at the data. I don't think that models did much to generate this belief.","title":"Why Do Some Households Hold Lots of Wealth?"},{"location":"thoughts/models_beliefs.html#implications","text":"If models don't change beliefs, then we are probably wasting a lot of time in macro research.

Examples: Hsieh/Hurst/Jones/Klenow (Econometrica, forthcoming) could use panel data to get a better idea of individuals' comparative advantage for particular occupations. Lagakos/Waugh (AER) could use panel data to see whether urban/rural migrants experience large wage gains (similar to Glazer/Mare using US data). An extreme example: Manuelli/Seshadri (AER) use essentially no data at all. Could one not pin down key model parameters, such as \"the elasticity\" in Manuelly/Seshadri, more precisely with more/better data? One possible resolution of the puzzle: these papers really point out the possibility that a particular cause-effect mechanism could be empirically important. To do so, they write down a simple model and calibrate it in a simple way. The point being made would then be rather limited: one can write down a non-nonsensical model and stick in non-nonsensical parameter values and find that the mechanism under study is \"big.\" Of course, this is not the way the papers are written. They typically contain quantitative statements, such as \"the entire rise in the US college wage premium can be accounted for by the changing relative abilities of college graduates\" (Hendricks/Schoellman, JME 2014; to point a finger at myself). An innocent reader (like myself, until recently) might take the quantitative results at face value. But then it is puzzling that the models so stylized and that not more data are used to discipline them. But then: if the papers merely point out a possibility, this puzzle is resolved. Perhaps, the authors understand that possibilities are all we can get from quantitative models. So we might as well proceed with simple examples instead of complicated models and detailed data. But then we have a major problem: quantitative economics is then limited to accumulating potentially important explanations for what we observe. In many cases, the number of explanations is quite large. Take the case of cross-country income gaps. If we add up the fractions explained by physical capital, human capital, misallocation, capital import frictions, etc., we end up explaining the observed income gaps many times over. Something seems fundamentally wrong here.","title":"On simple models calibrated using little data"},{"location":"thoughts/quantitative_models.html#the-question-of-simple-models-and-little-data","text":"For some time, I have been wondering why many highly competent authors in quantitative economics work with very stylized models and with very limited data.","title":"The Question of Simple Models and Little Data"},{"location":"thoughts/quantitative_models.html#examples","text":"Hsieh/Hurst/Jones/Klenow (Econometrica, forthcoming) could use panel data to get a better idea of individuals' comparative advantage for particular occupations.

And nobody thinks this is odd. As a referee, I commonly encounter authors that appear not to understand or not to be familiar with the literature. This is one cost of the lack of specialization. Another cost is duplication of effort. If an author wants to work with a particular dataset, he/she typically just figures out how that dataset \"works.\" This leads to mistakes and it wastes time. We need authors that specialize in specific datasets. Similarly, very few economists know how to write reasonable computer code.

No evidence that the code has been tested. Globals are used to set parameters. No easy way of swapping out model elements, even though a typical paper solves many different versions of a model. Little useful documentation. Essentially no general purpose code is used. Essentially no code is used that was written by someone else. In other words, most economists violate all the guidelines one would typically learn in Programming 101. Most code that is written is likely wrong. We need authors who specialize in programming. Consider again how other disciplines work. As an extreme example, experimental physics employs a wide variety of specialists (engineers, programmers, machine shop workers, etc). This makes it possible to run very complex projects, such as particle beam colliders. Economists do nothing of remotely similar complexity.
