Prof. Lutz Hendricks. UNC \u00b6 Course objective: \u00b6 Econ720 is the first course in the macro PhD sequence. Its objective is to learn about the standard models commonly used in macroeconomics. In parallel, the course develops the mathematical methods used to characterize the equilibria of the models. This is a largely a theory and methods course. But we will cover some applications to topics such as the distribution of wealth. The course schedule contains more detail.

For online discussions, I suggest to sign up at Econ StackExchange : there you can post questions that are not directly class related. The questions have to be specific (discussion questions are not permitted). For questions that are directly class related, please use the Sakai forum. You can of course also just email me directly, but using the forums has the benefit that others can see the conversations (and chime in). Grading \u00b6 Midterm: 40%. Final: 50%. Problem sets: 10%. Exams are closed book and cover all material taught. Per university requirement, the final will last 3 hours. Review problems are for your practice and not to be turned in. Many are questions from previous exams. If a student misses a midterm, the weight of that midterm in the course grade will be added to the weight on the student\u2019s final. An exception will be made for University-approved absences . Students with this type of absence may request a make-up examination at a time convenient to both student and instructor.

Per Krusell\u2019s Real Macroeconomic Theory manuscript, 2014 version Additional readings are in the slides. Rules \u00b6 Questions and comments are always welcome. Come to my office hours!

Required University Boilerplate Text \u00b6 This fall semester, while we are in the midst of a global pandemic, all enrolled students are required to wear a mask covering your mouth and nose at all times in our classroom. This requirement is to protect our educational community \u2014 your classmates and me \u2013 as we learn together. If you choose not to wear a mask, or wear it improperly, I will ask you to leave immediately, and I will submit a report to the Office of Student Conduct. At that point you will be disenrolled from this course for the protection of our educational community. An exemption to the mask wearing community standard will not typically be considered to be a reasonable accommodation. Individuals with a disability or health condition that prevents them from safely\u202fwearing a face\u202fmask must seek alternative accommodations through the Accessibility Resources and Service.
