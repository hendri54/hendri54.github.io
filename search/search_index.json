College \u00b6 College qualities over time \u00b6 Are college qualities highly persistent over time? Do colleges move around in the quality distribution? Which colleges move up and why? College Stratification \u00b6 Hoxby (2009) shows that colleges became more stratified in the 1960s. Her data end in 2006. They are also not publicly available. Moreover, Hoxby's data show that initially highly selective colleges became more selective over time and vice versa. A different, but related, question is: did colleges become more homogeneous? How did the CDF of college \"qualities\" change over time? What happened more recently? Possible data sources: IPEDS (since about 1985) and HERI freshmen surveys. Cross-country Income Differences \u00b6 Do immigrant earnings rise with source country GDP? \u00b6 But see JOEG 2018/139 (never published) Occupational downgrading of immigrants (2020) \u00b6 Idea: If immigrants from poor countries have less hc (given schooling), they should be employed in jobs that require less hc. Those are jobs held by natives with lower schooling. Quantify this: Construct avg native schooling by [occupation, industry]. For each source/host pair: compute the average gap between immigrant and native schooling in [occ, ind] cells. This is a measure of occupational downgrading. To what extent is the wage gap between immigrants and similar natives explained by this? Jones (2014) has strong claims about downgrading. How do those hold up? The task content of immigrant jobs (2020) \u00b6 Todd Schoellman may have done this. Inequality \u00b6 Hsieh/Klenow for Immigrants \u00b6 Hsieh et al 2019 show that women and black men were underrepresented in certain occupations in the 1960s. Over time, the gaps diminished, suggesting that the allocation of talent improved. Is there evidence for a similar convergence among immigrants? How important are inheritances (2020) \u00b6 Using the SCF, calculate the fraction of wealth inherited by the rich. Feiveson and Sabelhaus 2018 do something like this. They conclude that the rich likely inherit a large fraction of their wealth. Those calculations are quite sensitive to the assumed real interest rates. Sources of earnings \"shocks\" (2021) \u00b6 Administrative data show that earnings \"shocks\" are asymmetric (frequent small positive and rare large negative shocks).
